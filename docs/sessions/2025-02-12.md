# Session: 2025-02-12

## Overview

First full working session with Claude Code as a video production collaborator. Built the foundational skill set, tested on two contrasting projects, and established the long-term vision.

## What happened

### 1. Created 5 reusable skills (slash commands)

Designed and implemented the core analysis toolkit:

- `/scan-project` — directory structure scanner
- `/check-specs` — technical metadata extraction (ffprobe)
- `/extract-frames` — adaptive frame extraction (ffmpeg)
- `/analyze-composition` — shot size, angle, and pattern analysis
- `/analyze-audio` — per-second RMS audio level analysis (Python)

Key design decision: skills are written in English for portability, while Claude Code communicates in Japanese during sessions.

### 2. Tested on an AI-generated music video

Ran all 5 skills on a fully AI-generated MV (~3 min). Results:

- Frame extraction and composition analysis worked well — identified bookend structure (opening/closing motifs), 7-act narrative arc, and shot size rhythm
- Audio analysis revealed volume arc aligned with narrative tension
- Script (script.md) in the project enabled deep analysis against creative intent

### 3. Tested on a live-action PV (the "answer check" experiment)

This was the key experiment. Given 39 raw footage clips from a restaurant PV with no script:

**What Claude Code did well:**
- Classified all clips by content and role
- Identified hero shots (signature dish close-ups, satisfaction moments)
- Found usable sections within a 78-second long take
- Proposed a complete 2-minute edit structure

**What Claude Code got wrong:**
- Proposed an observational/documentary structure
- The actual edit was a first-person guide ("let me introduce my favorite restaurant")
- Without a script, Claude Code couldn't determine **whose story** was being told

**Key insight:** Material classification works. Narrative perspective requires a script. This is the boundary between what Claude Code can infer from footage alone vs. what needs creative direction.

### 4. Established the hybrid vision

The orchestrator's goal is fusing live-action and AI-generated video. Today's experiments showed Claude Code can analyze both types of footage, making it uniquely positioned as a bridge between the two worlds.

Role division emerged:
- **Claude Code**: technical analysis, footage triage, project orchestration, API integration
- **Claude Web**: creative writing, scriptwriting, narrative voice
- **Ideal**: Claude Code calls Anthropic API to consult Claude for creative tasks, eliminating the browser-terminal copy-paste bottleneck

### 5. Set up CLAUDE.md and git

- Created CLAUDE.md defining the collaborator role and core principle: "Always propose what's next"
- Initialized git with strict whitelist .gitignore (only tracks text/config, zero media files)
- Published as a public GitHub repository for portfolio use

## Decisions made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Whitelist .gitignore | Public repo must never accidentally include media files |
| Public docs/ vs private project documents/ | Session logs are portfolio-worthy; scripts and client details stay in project folders |
| Skills in English | Skills are shareable; conversations are contextual |
| Script is the bridge | Without it, Claude Code can classify but not narrate |

## Next steps

- Receive the script for the upcoming hybrid project (live-action + AI)
- Design `/propose-edit` skill (given script + classified footage → edit structure)
- Explore Anthropic API integration for creative writing consultation
- Continue building the skill library based on real production needs
